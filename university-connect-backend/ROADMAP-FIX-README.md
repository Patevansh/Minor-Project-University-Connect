# AI Roadmap Generator Fix

This fix addresses a critical issue where the AI Roadmap generator was ignoring user input and defaulting to React.js in the generated roadmaps.

## The Problem

The AI roadmap generator was not properly substituting the user's selected subject (e.g., "Python") in the prompt sent to the Perplexity AI API. Instead, hardcoded references to "React.js" were being sent regardless of user input.

## The Fix

1. **Improved String Handling**: Eliminated nested template literals that were causing substitution issues
2. **Explicit Subject Extraction**: Enhanced the logic to extract the main subject from user input
3. **Direct String Construction**: Used explicit string concatenation instead of template literals for the API prompt
4. **JSON Structure Validation**: Added explicit replacement of all template variables in the example JSON structure
5. **Debugging Enhancements**: Added detailed logging to track what's being sent to the API
6. **Input Validation**: Added better validation and cleaning of the subject name
7. **Response Verification**: Added logic to verify the subject is correctly used in the response
8. **Fallback System**: Improved the fallback roadmap generation to use the correct subject

## Testing the Fix

1. Run the `fix-roadmap.bat` script to install the fixed controller and routes
2. Try the roadmap generator with different subjects (Python, JavaScript, Data Science, etc.)
3. Check the logs to verify the correct subject is being sent to the API
4. If you need to revert to the original files, instructions are provided in the batch file

## New Test Endpoints

- `/api/ai-roadmap/test-perplexity-fixed?subject=Python`: Tests the fixed prompt construction
- A new test script `test-roadmap.js` can be run directly to verify the fix

## Files Modified

- `controllers/aiRoadmapController.js`: Complete rewrite of the prompt construction logic
- `routes/aiRoadmapRoutes.js`: Added a new test endpoint with the fixed implementation

## How to Verify the Fix

When generating a roadmap, check the console logs for:
- "Final cleaned main subject: Python" (or whatever subject you entered)
- "Prompt for AI with main subject: Python"
- The JSON structure in the response should contain references to your subject, not React.js
